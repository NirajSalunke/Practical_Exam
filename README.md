# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSL) Assignments

This branch contains practical assignments focused on implementing core data structure and algorithm concepts using Python and C++. Each assignment explores different computational techniques such as set operations, matrix operations, searching, sorting, and data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists.

## Assignment List

1. **Group Computations**

   - Operations on student groups using functions to find intersections, unions, and exclusions of groups.

2. **String Operations**

   - Perform various string operations like finding the longest word, checking for palindromes, and counting word occurrences.

3. **Matrix Computations**

   - Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose of matrices.

4. **Search Algorithms**

   - Implement Linear, Sentinel, Binary, and Fibonacci search algorithms for student roll numbers.

5. **Sorting Algorithms (Part 1)**

   - Implement Selection, Bubble, Insertion, and Shell sorts to sort student percentages.

6. **Sorting Algorithms (Part 2)**

   - Implement Quick Sort for student percentages.

7. **Cinemax Theater Ticket Booking System**

   - Use a doubly circular linked list to manage seat booking, cancellation, and availability in a theater.

8. **Appointment Scheduler**

   - Manage appointment bookings using a linked list, including sorting based on time.

9. **Delimiter Matching**

   - Check if expressions are well-parenthesized using stacks.

10. **Infix to Postfix Conversion and Evaluation**

    - Convert infix expressions to postfix and evaluate using stacks.

11. **Job Queue Simulation**

    - Simulate a job queue using C++ with functions for adding and deleting jobs.

12. **Priority Queue**

    - Implement a priority queue in C++ with priority-based ordering.

13. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**
    - Simulate a deque with addition and deletion operations from both ends.
