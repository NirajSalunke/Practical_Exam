# Practical Assignments Repository

This repository is organized to store and manage practical assignments for three main subjects:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSL)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Computer Graphics (CG)**

Each subject has its own dedicated branch, containing folders for individual assignments. This README will guide you on how to navigate to each branch, understand the purpose of the assignments, and use this repository effectively.
